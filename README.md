Terrain-Calibrated Sunrise & Sunset

Sun Clock doesn’t just show generic sunrise and sunset times – it learns your actual horizon.

With one tap on Calibrate to Real Sunrise (when you first see the sun) or Calibrate to Real Sunset (when it disappears), Sun Clock measures the difference between standard astronomical times and what you see in your real environment – mountains, trees, buildings and all.

That “horizon offset” is then saved locally on your device and automatically applied to:

Sunrise & sunset times

Day length

Golden hour & blue hour windows

The live countdown to the next solar event

The result: a ultra-simple, offline-friendly sun clock that matches your actual sky, not just a flat-earth horizon model.
